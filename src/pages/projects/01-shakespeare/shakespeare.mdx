    Recently, I found Steve on Twitter and saw how he was sharing design tips
    targeted at developers with no design background, I followed him in the
    blink of an eye. I'm not exaggerating when I say that he was one of my best
    follows in 2018. This is really incredible and thus I would like to share it
    with all of you.
