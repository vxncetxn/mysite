  A button is announced to screen readers as a button when the proper element —
  the almighty button is used
</QuotePara>

<DefaultPara className="defaultpara-writing">
  Putting aside the UX side of the coin and whether or not an icon alone is
  enough to convey meaning and functionality to users, many implementations of
  these buttons today lack the proper accessibility that makes them meaningful
  to users of assistive technologies.
</DefaultPara>

<DefaultPara className="defaultpara-writing">
  While the seemingly popular aria-label is a perfectly valid way to add an
  accessible name to a button (and/or other components), it is certainly not the
  only way, let alone the best. You could always just put text in it, for
  example. But what if the designer or the UI enforces the absence of visual
  text next to an icon?
</DefaultPara>

<DefaultPara className="defaultpara-writing">
  There is a handful of ways that an icon button can be implemented accessibly.
  This article is an overview of them all.
</DefaultPara>

<DefaultPara className="defaultpara-writing">
  A button is announced to screen readers as a button when the proper element —
  the almighty button is used, or when an element has a role = "button" on it.
  Either way, when a button is announced as one, users expect to be able to
  interact with it in a certain way, which includes being able to activate the
  button using either the ENTER or SPACE keys.
</DefaultPara>

<DefaultPara className="defaultpara-writing">
  This means that if you choose not to use the native button element, you’ll
  need to reimplement that native behavior and functionality yourself using
  JavaScript. But who would want to create a brittle implementation of features
  that are provided to them by default by the browser when they can save both
  time and effort using a simple button, right? ;)
</DefaultPara>

<DefaultPara className="defaultpara-writing">
  To inspect what the accessible name of a button is and, therefore, how it will
  be announced by a screen reader, you can use the Chrome devtools. Next to the
  Style tab, you’ll find an “Accessibility“ tab, inside which you will find
  something that looks like this:
</DefaultPara>

<DefaultPara className="defaultpara-writing">
  The accessible name for the button can be defined in several ways, as you can
  see in the image above. When you put plain text inside the button, that text
  content can then be used as a name for the button, which is then announced:
  "Send Message, Button" by VoiceOver.
</DefaultPara>

<DefaultPara className="defaultpara-writing">
  You can inspect the button below yourself and check the accessible name in the
  devtools, and fire up your screen reader of choice to see how it is announced.
</DefaultPara>

<DefaultPara className="defaultpara-writing">
  Now, what happens when we have an icon inside the button?
</DefaultPara>

<CodePara>
{`onSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const job = {
        title: 'Developer',
        company: 'Facebook' 
    };
}
`}

</CodePara>
