You can do so much with SVG Filters. As I showed in my talk, you can recreate many graphic editor capabilities using almost exactly the same steps in SVG using filter primitives. But there are also limitations. I was particularly interested in recreating one particular Photoshop color glitch effect when I was working on the demos for the talk, but I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a way to do that using SVGâ€™s filter primitives. I could be wrong, though. After all, I only scratched the surface and stopped halfway through my research because I had to focus on client work. So if you know a way to do this, please feel free to share and tweet at me.`}</p>\n    <p>{`After my talk, many people expressed their interest in experimenting with SVG filters, and many of them already started sharing great demos on Codepen. Yoksel has been tweeting about her SVG filter experiments lately that I highly recommend checking out. Others have requested more resources after my talk, which prompted me to write this article today. So, I hope you too find it useful and are excited enough to experiment with SVG filters today.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Cheers,\nSara`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
